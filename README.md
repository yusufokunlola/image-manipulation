This project seeks to perform image manipulation using the PIL library.

<p>The following tasks are performed by the pipeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load the image with <code>Image.open</code> and create paths to save our images to</li>
<li>Convert the image to grayscale</li>
<li>Save the grayscale image</li>
<li>Rotate, crop, and zoom in on the image and save the new image</li>
</ul>

<p>To manipulate your images using this code, simply load your files in the datasets folder and edit the "image_paths" in the notebook. </p>

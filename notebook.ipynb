    "## Image Processing Pipeline with PIL\n",
    "<p>Pillow (PIL) has a number of common image manipulation tasks built into the library.</p>\n",
    "<p>The Image module is used to represent a PIL image. The module also provides a number of factory functions, including functions to load images from files, and to create new images. The documentation for <a href=\"https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/Image.html\">Image</a> in Pillow gives a comprehensive view of what this object can do.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Operations that Pillow provides include:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>resizing</li>\n",
    "<li>cropping</li>\n",
    "<li>rotating</li>\n",
    "<li>flipping</li>\n",
    "<li>converting to grayscale</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>These kinds of manipulations are part of the pipeline for turning a small number of images into more images to create training data for machine learning algorithms. This technique is called <a href=\"http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2017/pdfs/300.pdf\">data augmentation</a>, and it is a common technique for image classification.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>This pipeline does the following:</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Load the image with <code>Image.open</code> and create paths to save our images to</li>\n",
    "<li>Convert the image to grayscale</li>\n",
    "<li>Save the grayscale image</li>\n",
    "<li>Rotate, crop, and zoom in on the image and save the new image</li>\n",
    "</ul>"
